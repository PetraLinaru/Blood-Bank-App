# Blood Bank App

There are three types of users: donors, doctors and admin.

    ★Donors can check for availability and make appointments, as well as check their badge and rank. More than that, a donour could mark his own appointment as done, but only if it's for today's appointment. \n
    ★Doctors can see all appointments,manage appointments, as well as mark appointments as done/undone. 
    ★Admin is in charge with creating and editing doctors' accounts. Regular admin stuff.
